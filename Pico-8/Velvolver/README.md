## Velvolver
(title tentative)

Velvolver is a 8-directional shooter game I'm working on for the Pico-8 platform. 
It is a love letter to the unspoken button-mashing "rhythm" of retro games that featured intense coordination,
such as Mega Man or Contra. It also features more modern systems such as stamina management inspired by Dark Souls,
an ultimate attack inspired by Overwatch, and an active reloading system inspired by Gears of War.

It is a condensed Proof-of-concept for a game I would like to expand on in Unity.
All music, graphics and programming are my design, unless otherwise noted.
