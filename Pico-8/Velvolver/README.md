## Velvolver

Velvolver is a 8-directional shooter game I'm working on for the Pico-8 platform. 
It is a love letter to the unspoken "rhythm" of retro games that featured intense coordination and button-mashing,
such as Megaman or Contra.

It is a condensed Proof-of-concept for a game I would like to expand on in Unity.
All music, graphics and programming are my design, unless otherwise noted.
