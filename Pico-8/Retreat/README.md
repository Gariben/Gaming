## Retreat

Retreat is a "stack-up puzzle" style game I made to learn on the Pico-8 platform. 

Not satisifed with the base game, I decided to expand on it to include several special effects and a small background story.

All assets and programming are my design, though I borrowed the block sprite from the [jelpi.p8](https://github.com/caffo/carts/blob/master/demos/jelpi.p8) demo and expanded on it.
The music resembles [the original Godzilla theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En4aAGpVuYU). I was inspired by it. It's pretty sweet.

When I am finished with the game I will upload it to the Pico-8 where it will be available for anyone to play on the web.
The .p8 cart itself can be played on the Pico-8 platform on Windows, Linux, Mac and Raspberry Pi.
