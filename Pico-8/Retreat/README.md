## Retreat

Retreat is a "stack-up puzzle" style game I made to learn on the Pico-8 platform. 

Not satisifed with the base game, I decided to expand on it to include several special effects and a small background story.

When I am finished with the game I will upload it to the Pico-8 where it will be available for anyone to play on the web.
The .p8 cart itself can be played on the Pico-8 platform on Windows, Linux, Mac and Raspberry Pi.
